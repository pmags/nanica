# NANICA - RaspberryPi Baby Cam Project

## Project goals:
Since we learnt that we were going to be parents that we start looking for DIY projects for the new comer? Why, well because we think of it of work of love, because we suck at bricolage & we are techies =).

This Repo will mainly compile our journey with raspberry pi to build a solid babycam. Will be used as playground for us to learn how this board computer works. Further learn about bash commands and expand our python knowledges. 

During our journey we will be inspired by other projects and use code from other open projects and live links to their projects here.

**Goals:** 
- stream video and sound. 
- No real need for a specific app, we can use vlc or similar. 
- Lag is not an issue (yet).
- Needs a shutdown button and a camera ir filter changer.
- We need an installer to be easier for next stages. (linux bash file).
- We need some kind of boxing solution.
